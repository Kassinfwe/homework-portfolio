			<p>Alice Kassinger is a native of Washington, DC, but has grown extremely fond of all the excellent hammock spots in Denver. She graduated with a degree in Psychology from Washington University in St. Louis in 2014, and hopes one day that she will not regret majoring in the humanities. </p>

			<p>Alice has discovered a passion for coding that has led her to develop several (fake) sites. She hopes you will pay her money, for something, some day. </p>
